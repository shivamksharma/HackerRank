/* NOTE - Dont Just copy the code because taking a copy of existing code in your project and repurposing it – violates coding best practices like Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY). It’s one of the most cited examples of technical debt, a lazy way of working, sloppy and short-sighted: an antipattern that adds to the long term cost of keeping a code base alive. Copying and pasting code (“copy-paste”) is a primitive but very common form of software re-use. Unfortunately, this practice is fraught with dangers not least of which is duplicating bugs and security defects throughout the system.*/
